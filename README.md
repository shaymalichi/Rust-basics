# Rust Basics

Rust is strongly typed and statically typed language.
- strongly typed: all variable type known and checked during compilation.
- strongly typed: type conversions need's to be explicit otherwise will result in compilation error. 
##### rust using an ownership system in order to maintain security of software. 


## Ownership
- set of rules of how a rust program manages memory. 
- strict rules that insures memory safety.
- alternative to a garbage collector. 

| garbage collector | Ownership | 
|-----------------|-----------------|
|software that during runtime checks for unused data  |release data based on program structure  |
| slow, software in the background | more efficient |

### rules of ownership: 
- any data has a unieqe "Owner"
- owner that goes out of the scope gets dropped.
- binding variables moves ownership 
- there are mutable references and immutable references (only 1 mutable reference or as many immutable references)
